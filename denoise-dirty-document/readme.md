This is a school project that tackles a document denoising challenge on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/denoising-dirty-documents) by exploring the use of
different deep learning model architectures including Convolution Neural Networks, long short-term
memory and attention mechanisms. 
An image cropping method was also applied to the training data to expand the training set, which led to significant improvements and achieved rank 8 compared to the contest leaderboard results.

A detailed pdf report was included, it records the detailed methodology and results of the project.
